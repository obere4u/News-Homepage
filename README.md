## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This particular task took me almost 8 hour (non-consistent due to the poor power supply etc). I was able to finish the task and learned
- How to build a Hamburger menu
- How to use flexbox model
- SVG
- Use of lighthouse for performance analyzing

### Continued development

I will continue my learning of responsive webpage and CSS animation

### Useful resources
